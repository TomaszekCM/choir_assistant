# choir_assistant

The main goal of this application is to organize work in the choir. From the administrative point of wiev, it is important
to know will be present on which event (concert/rehearsal). It is also important to know whether on each event we have all 
voices for each song that we plan to perform. Finally, it is important to know who and how much is devoted to the choir's activity.
Considering the above, this app gives choir members opportunity to see details of each event and song, and to write whether they will be able to attend in each event and to declare wich voice they are singing in each song, what gives the conductor all necessary information and lets to organize work.
